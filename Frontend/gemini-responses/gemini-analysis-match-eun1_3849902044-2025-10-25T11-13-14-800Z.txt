## Strategic Analysis

# League of Legends Match Analysis

## 1. Team Composition Analysis
### Winning Team (200)
**Strengths:**
- **High Damage Output:** Aphelios and Kennen provide significant sustained and burst damage. Viego adds to this with excellent snowball potential.
- **Strong Engage and Follow-up:** Kennen's ultimate offers strong engage and crowd control, followed by Aphelios' consistent damage.
- **Sustain and Peel:** Soraka provides excellent sustain for the team and peel for the carries, enabling them to survive longer in fights.
- **Splitpush/Dueling Power:** Garen can split push effectively and duel opponents.
- **Hyper Carry Potential:** Aphelios is a scaling hyper carry who can dominate late-game team fights.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Vulnerable to Hard Engage:** While Soraka provides peel, the team lacks a dedicated front line outside of Garen. A well-coordinated engage from the enemy team could be problematic.
- **Early Game Vulnerability:** Aphelios and Soraka need to scale into the mid-game, which could make them vulnerable to early game pressure.
- **Vision Control Reliant on Soraka:** While everyone contributed a bit, Soraka is the primary vision provider, making the team vulnerable if she is caught out.

### Losing Team (100)
**Strengths:**
- **High Mobility:** Lillia, Akali, and Rakan offer high mobility, allowing for flanking and outplays.
- **Poke Potential:** Smolder provides ranged poke damage.
- **AP Damage:** Lillia, Sylas and Akali provide AP damage which can make it harder to itemize against.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Lack of Consistent Damage:** Despite Smolder's potential, the team lacks consistent damage output in team fights. Akali is more of an assassin, and Sylas struggled significantly in this match.
- **Weak Frontline:** The team has minimal frontline presence, making them vulnerable to being overrun in team fights.
- **Poor Crowd Control:** Rakan is the primary source of CC, making the team reliant on him to initiate and control fights.
- **Poor Scaling:** The team composition tends to fall off in the late game compared to the winning team's composition.

## 2. Key Performance Indicators
### Winning Team
- **Garen (3/7/9):** While his KDA isn't stellar, his job was to split push and soak damage which he probably did.
- **Viego (23/1/14):** An outstanding performance. Clearly snowballed early and dominated the game. Excellent objective control and assassination potential.
- **Kennen (10/2/12):** Solid performance, contributing significant damage and crowd control in team fights. Excellent engage potential.
- **Aphelios (12/3/13):** A strong damage dealer, consistently applying pressure and securing kills. His damage output was the highest in the game.
- **Soraka (1/8/24):** Despite the deaths, her assist count demonstrates significant contribution to team fights through healing and utility. High vision score indicates good map control.

### Losing Team
- **Lillia (8/9/0):** While her KDA isn't terrible, her lack of assists suggests she wasn't effectively contributing to team fights. Her damage was significant, but ultimately insufficient.
- **Sylas (3/12/3):** A very poor performance. Likely struggled in lane and failed to impact the game significantly.
- **Akali (3/10/0):** Struggled to find kills and contribute to team fights. Her damage output was low, suggesting she wasn't able to effectively assassinate targets.
- **Smolder (5/7/2):** Decent CS, but ultimately couldn't carry the game. His damage was significant, but not enough to turn the tide.
- **Rakan (2/11/9):** Despite a high vision score, his KDA is poor, indicating he was caught out often. His engage likely wasn't effective enough to secure advantages.

## 3. Critical Moments
- **Early Viego Snowball:** Viego's early kills likely created a gold and experience advantage that allowed him to dominate the game.
- **Poor Objective Control by Losing Team:** The lack of any dragons, barons, or heralds by the losing team indicates a failure to contest objectives and secure advantages.
- **Winning Team's Coordinated Team Fights:** The winning team's ability to engage and follow up effectively in team fights likely secured key objectives and kills.
- **Losing Team's Lack of Vision Control:** The losing team's relatively low vision scores (except for Rakan) likely led to them being caught out and unable to effectively contest objectives.
- **Winning Team's Focus on Aphelios:** The losing team's inability to shut down Aphelios allowed him to scale into a hyper carry and dominate team fights.

## 4. Strategic Insights (Winning Team)
- **Prioritized Objective Control:** Although no objectives were taken, they likely had control of the area around objectives.
- **Capitalized on Early Advantage:** Viego's early lead was effectively translated into map control and objective control.
- **Strong Team Fight Coordination:** The winning team's ability to engage and follow up effectively in team fights secured key kills and objectives.
- **Protect the Carry:** They likely prioritized protecting Aphelios, allowing him to scale and deal massive damage.

## 5. Improvement Suggestions (Losing Team)
- **Improve Vision Control:** Invest in more wards and focus on denying vision to the enemy team.
- **Coordinate Engages:** Work on coordinating engages and following up effectively in team fights.
- **Prioritize Objective Control:** Contest objectives and secure advantages to prevent the enemy team from snowballing.
- **Focus on Shutting Down Enemy Carries:** Identify and focus on shutting down key enemy carries, such as Aphelios.
- **Improve Laning Phase:** Focus on improving laning phase performance to avoid falling behind early.

## 6. Meta Analysis
- **Hyper Carry Compositions:** The winning team composition reflects the current meta trend of prioritizing hyper carries and providing them with protection and resources.
- **Snowball Potential:** Viego's performance highlights the importance of snowballing early advantages in the current meta.
- **Importance of Objective Control:** The winning team's focus on objective control reflects the importance of securing advantages and denying resources to the enemy team.

## 7. Individual Player Analysis
- **Viego (Winning Team):** Outstanding performance, showcasing excellent snowball potential and objective control. Potential area for improvement: Vision score could be higher.
- **Aphelios (Winning Team):** Dominated team fights with high damage output. Potential area for improvement: Improve positioning to avoid being caught out.
- **Rakan (Losing Team):** High vision score, but poor KDA. Needs to improve decision-making and avoid being caught out. Potential area for improvement: Focus on engaging more effectively and protecting carries.
- **Sylas (Losing Team):** Very poor performance. Needs to improve laning phase and team fight participation. Potential area for improvement: Focus on farming and building items effectively to impact the game.
